## Usage
Clone, fork or download the repository, run `npm install` and start coding. That's it!

### NPM packages
To install all the required NPM packages, run `npm install`.

### Bower components
The Bower components are automatically installed after `npm install`.

However, if that doesn't work, for some strange reason, run `bower install`.

### Gulp
There are 2 main gulp tasks to run:


| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| `gulp` (default) | Runs the distribution tasks and then starts the watch task, that listens for changes to `.js` and `.css` files. |
| `gulp dist` | Runs only the distribution tasks and then stops. |
